                NPM Smell's ultimate goal is to minimize the impact of supply chain attacks in NPM.
            </p>
            <p>
                It tries to do so by highlighting trivial or outdated dependencies with high
                download numbers so that package maintainers can act and remove those dependencies.
            </p>
            <h2>Why?</h2>
            <p>
                Security. NPM contains a lot of trivial or outdated packages. Yet they are still
                being downloaded by millions. This makes them a prime candidate for the next supply
                chain attack.
            </p>
            <p>
                A popular attack vector is taking over those packages and updating them with
                malicious code.
            </p>
            <!-- <p>
                Trivial and outdated packages are a good target for this kind of attack especially
                if they also have high download numbers.
            </p> -->
            <h3>What are trivial or outdated packages?</h3>
            <h4>Trivial</h4>
            <p>
                Trivial packages are packages that should be common knowledge for any JavaScript
                developer. Like checking for an array or checking if a number is odd. While the
                functionality is often trivial they also sometimes come with additional
                dependencies. Unnecessarily increasing the attack surface.
            </p>
            <h4>Outdated</h4>
            <p>
                Outdated packages are packages whose functionality they provide is now supported by
                the language itself.
