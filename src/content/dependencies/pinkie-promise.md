description: Outdated Promise polyfill
type: obsolete-js
implementation: javascript.builtins.Promise

This library was used as a Promise polyfill for environments that did not support Promises natively.

However all modern JavaScript environments, including Node.js (since version 0.12) and all major browsers have been supporting Promises natively for many years now, making this polyfill unnecessary.
